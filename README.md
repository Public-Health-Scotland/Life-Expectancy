# Life-Expectancy

This repository contains scripts that generate life expectancy (LE) and healthy life expectancy (HLE) estimates produced by the ScotPHO team.

The scripts include code to generate base population, deaths and self-assessed health files as well as a function to calculate LE and HLE if required.  

The function includes a paramter that specifies if the maximum agegroup for the life table should be 85+ years or 90+ years,
