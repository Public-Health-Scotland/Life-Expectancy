# Life-Expectancy

This repository contains scripts that generate life expectancy (LE) and healthy life expectancy (HLE) estimates produced by the ScotPHO team.

There are scripts to generate base population, deaths and self-assessed health files as well as two functions which use base files to calculate 
LE or HLE.  The two functions use same calculation methodology to derive LE or HLE but differ in the maximum expected age group - one expects
max age of 85+ years the other is 90 years plus.
